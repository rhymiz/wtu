## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Automated Install (Recommended)

Use the install script for a guided installation:

```bash
# Download and run the installer
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhymiz/wtu/main/install.sh | bash

# Or if you've cloned the repo
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
- Check Git version compatibility (2.5+ required)
- Detect your shell (bash/zsh) and configure it automatically
- Install shell completions for tab completion support
- Optionally configure worktree settings
- Install from local file or download from GitHub
- Work on both macOS and Linux

### Quick Install

```bash
# Download the utilities
curl -o ~/.git-worktree-utils.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhymiz/wtu/main/git-worktree-utils.sh

# Add to your shell configuration
echo 'source ~/.git-worktree-utils.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
# OR for zsh users
echo 'source ~/.git-worktree-utils.sh' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Manual Install

1. Copy the script to your preferred location:
   ```bash
   cp git-worktree-utils.sh ~/.git-worktree-utils.sh
   ```

2. Source it in your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
   ```bash
   source ~/.git-worktree-utils.sh
   ```

3. Reload your shell or open a new terminal

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configure the utilities by setting environment variables in your shell configuration:

```bash
# Base directory where worktrees will be created (default: ../)
export WORKTREE_BASE_DIR="$HOME/projects/worktrees"

# Prefix for worktree directory names (default: wt-)
export WORKTREE_PREFIX="branch-"
```

## üìñ Commands Reference

### Core Commands

#### `wt-add <branch> [name]`
Create a new worktree for a branch. If the branch doesn't exist, it will be created.

```bash
# Create worktree for existing branch
wt-add feature/authentication

# Create worktree with custom directory name
wt-add feature/authentication auth-feature

# Create new branch and worktree
wt-add feature/new-feature
```

#### `wt-list` (alias: `wtl`)
List all worktrees with their current branch and commit information.

```bash
wt-list
# Output:
# [1] /home/user/project/../wt-feature-auth
#     Commit: abc1234
#     Branch: feature/authentication
# [2] /home/user/project/../wt-bugfix
#     Commit: def5678
#     Branch: bugfix/issue-123
```

#### `wt-cd <branch-or-number>` (alias: `wtc`)
Change directory to a worktree by branch name or number from the list.

```bash
# Navigate by branch name
wt-cd feature/authentication

# Navigate by number from wt-list
wt-cd 2
```

#### `wt-remove <branch-or-path>` (alias: `wtr`)
Remove a worktree and clean up its reference.

```bash
# Remove by branch name
wt-remove feature/authentication

# Remove by path
wt-remove /path/to/worktree
```

#### `wt-status` (alias: `wts`)
Show the status of all worktrees, including uncommitted changes.

```bash
wt-status
# Output:
# ‚óè main (clean)
#   /home/user/project
# ‚óè feature/authentication (3 changes)
#   /home/user/project/../wt-feature-auth
# ‚óè bugfix/issue-123 (missing)
#   /home/user/project/../wt-bugfix
```

### Remote Operations

#### `wt-add-remote <remote-branch> [local-branch]`
Create a worktree tracking a remote branch.

```bash
# Create worktree from remote branch
wt-add-remote origin/feature/remote-feature

# Specify local branch name
wt-add-remote origin/feature/remote-feature my-local-feature
```

#### `wt-add-all-remote [remote]`
Create worktrees for all remote branches that don't already have local counterparts.

```bash
# Create worktrees for all origin branches
wt-add-all-remote

# Create worktrees for specific remote
wt-add-all-remote upstream
```

### Advanced Commands

#### `wt-pr <pr-number>`
Create a worktree for a GitHub pull request.

```bash
# Checkout PR #123
wt-pr 123
```

#### `wt-switch`
Interactive worktree switcher using fzf (requires fzf to be installed).

```bash
wt-switch
# Opens interactive fuzzy finder with preview
```

#### `wt-open <branch>`
Open a worktree in a new terminal window (supports Ghostty, Warp, iTerm, Terminal.app, gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm).

```bash
wt-open feature/authentication
```

#### `wt-clean`
Clean up stale worktree entries that no longer exist on disk.

```bash
wt-clean
```

#### `wt-help`
Display help information for all commands.

```bash
wt-help
```

## üéØ Common Workflows

### Feature Development

```bash
# Start working on a new feature
wt-add feature/user-authentication

# Navigate to the worktree
wt-cd feature/user-authentication

# Work on your feature...
# Meanwhile, if you need to fix something in main:
wt-cd main

# Check status across all worktrees
wt-status

# When done, remove the feature worktree
wt-remove feature/user-authentication
```

### Code Review Workflow

```bash
# Review a pull request
wt-pr 456

# Or checkout a colleague's remote branch
wt-add-remote origin/colleague/feature

# Open in new terminal for side-by-side comparison
wt-open colleague/feature

# Clean up after review
wt-remove pr-456
```

### Multiple Feature Development

```bash
# Set up worktrees for all remote features
wt-add-all-remote

# See what you have
wt-list

# Use interactive switcher to jump between them
wt-switch

# Check which ones have uncommitted work
wt-status
```

### Emergency Hotfix

```bash
# Quickly create a hotfix worktree
wt-add hotfix/critical-bug

# Your current work remains untouched in other worktrees
wt-cd hotfix/critical-bug

# Fix the bug, push, and remove
git add . && git commit -m "Fix critical bug"
git push origin hotfix/critical-bug
wt-remove hotfix/critical-bug
```

## üîå Shell Completion

Tab completion is automatically installed and configured by the install script. If you need to manually set it up:

### Bash Completion

```bash
# Download completion file
curl -o ~/.wtu-completions.bash https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhymiz/wtu/main/completions/bash/wtu-completions.bash

# The main script will automatically source it
```

### Zsh Completion

```bash
# Create completion directory
mkdir -p ~/.wtu/completions/zsh

# Download completion file
curl -o ~/.wtu/completions/zsh/_wtu https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhymiz/wtu/main/completions/zsh/_wtu

# The main script will automatically add to fpath
```

### What Can Be Completed

- **Branch names** - When creating or switching to worktrees
- **Remote branches** - When adding remote worktrees
- **Worktree numbers** - When using `wt-cd` with list numbers
- **Remote names** - When specifying which remote to use
- **File paths** - When removing worktrees by path

Example usage:
```bash
wt-add fea<TAB>              # Completes to feature branches
wt-cd <TAB>                  # Shows all worktree branches and numbers
wt-add-remote origin/<TAB>   # Shows all origin branches
wt-remove <TAB>              # Shows current worktrees
```

## üí° Tips and Tricks

### 1. Organize Your Worktrees
```bash
# Set a dedicated directory for all worktrees
export WORKTREE_BASE_DIR="$HOME/dev/worktrees/$(basename $(pwd))"
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Prefixes
```bash
# Different prefixes for different types
export WORKTREE_PREFIX="feat-"  # for features
export WORKTREE_PREFIX="fix-"   # for bugfixes
export WORKTREE_PREFIX="pr-"    # for pull requests
```

### 3. Combine with Git Aliases
```bash
# Add to your .gitconfig
[alias]
    wt = worktree
    wtl = !bash -c 'source ~/.git-worktree-utils.sh && wt-list'
```

### 4. Quick Status Check
```bash
# Add to your prompt to show current worktree
PS1='[\W$(git worktree list --porcelain | grep -c "^worktree" | sed "s/1//")WT] $ '
```

### 5. Cleanup Script
```bash
# Remove all worktrees except main
for wt in $(git worktree list --porcelain | grep "^worktree" | cut -d' ' -f2- | grep -v "$(pwd)"); do
    wt-remove "$wt"
done
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Worktree Already Exists
```bash
# Error: fatal: 'feature/x' is already checked out at '/path/to/worktree'
# Solution: Remove the existing worktree first
wt-remove feature/x
wt-add feature/x
```

### Cannot Remove Worktree
```bash
# Error: fatal: 'worktree' contains modified or untracked files
# Solution: Force remove (loses uncommitted changes!)
git worktree remove --force /path/to/worktree
```

### Missing Worktree Directory
```bash
# If you deleted a worktree directory manually
wt-clean  # This will clean up the git references
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Ensure the base directory exists and is writable
mkdir -p "$WORKTREE_BASE_DIR"
chmod 755 "$WORKTREE_BASE_DIR"
```
